          Okay..so, you already know everything, so i dont have to make a kickstart, but heres the thing.. Tofu, i miss you, a lot. I would be lyin if I don't say this, but you are my silver lining, the reason i go crazy, the reason i find myself awake all night thinking bout you... In this weird monotonous way, which i adore. You are my best decision, be it as friends, or be it in a relo..and you have no idea how much it hurts me every second when i realize you ain't here with me.. this website was built because i realized that maybe, your mood aint at its best, so this, is for you :)♡ And psst, if no one said it recently, I'm proud of you my lady, and i trust you with everythin. And at the same time, i love you, admire you, and look up on you :)♡
And only you.
